# Work Day Scheduler Challenge

## Description

This project is a day planner for a single day. It shows the current day, shows all the hour blocks from 9AM-5PM, shows if those blocks are in the past, present, or future, and lets the user write and save comments for each block. The project uses DayJS, Bootstrap, local storage, and DOM traversal through JQuery to function.

## Installation

## Usage
